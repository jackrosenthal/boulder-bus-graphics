# Boulder Bus Graphics Vectorization Project

This is my attempt to vectorize and preserve many of Boulder's fun bus logos.

The custom livery busses have been dwindling, and are becoming harder and harder
to find.  As of this time of writing, the JUMP, BOUND, and STAMPEDE custom
livery busses are no longer with us.  DASH (6217-6221) and SKIP (6222-6227)
livery busses are still in use, but they're 6000's series and unlikely to be
replaced with new custom livery busses.

Do what you want with these graphics, but do so at your own risk.  I'm not the
copyright holder; I only traced them in Inkscape.
